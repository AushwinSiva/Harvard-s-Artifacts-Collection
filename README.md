# Harvard-s-Artifacts-Collection
🎨 Harvard Art Museum Data Explorer

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to explore and analyze data from the Harvard Art Museum API & MySQL database in a clean and interactive way.

🔑 Key Features

Classification-Based Exploration: Select an artifact classification (e.g., Coins, Paintings, Prints) and instantly view related Metadata, Media, and Color data side by side.

Pretty JSON View: Artifact details are displayed in a readable, color-coded JSON format, making it easy to understand raw data.

SQL Integration: The app supports data migration into MySQL. Once inserted, artifacts are displayed in a scrollable, full-width SQL table for deeper exploration.

Tabbed Navigation: The interface provides three intuitive tabs:

Select Your Choice → Browse data from classifications

Migrate to SQL → Insert & view collected records in SQL tables

SQL Queries → Run custom SQL queries with built-in error handling for empty results

Performance Optimized: Data is fetched and displayed quickly without repetitive API calls.
